# Task 1
# Using the Titanic dataset, divide the passengers into two groups: Group 1 (male passengers only) and Group 2 (female passengers only).\
# Train separate classification models for each group, using ’Survived’ as the target variable and ’Age’ and ’Pclass’ as features. 
# Finally, measure and compare the accuracy scores of both models.






# Task 2
# cikit-learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier includes a method called clf.score(X, y), where clf is the classifier instance, X represents the feature attributes, 
# and y is the target (class) variable/attribute/feature. The score() method returns the model’s accuracy, indicating how well the model performs on prediction tasks, similar to the accuracy_score function.
# Using the Titanic dataset, train two classification models to evaluate whether using two or three features improves prediction accuracy for survival. 
# Compare these two feature sets: (a) Feature Set A: Pclass and Age (b) Feature Set B: Pclass, Age, and Gender 
# Measure the accuracy for both models and interpret which feature set provides better predictive performance.
# ...




# Task 3
# rain a classification algorithm to predict whether an attack was fatal, using the Activity and Age attributes from the Attack dataset. 
# Note that the Activity and Fatal columns contain non-numerical values and must be converted to a numerical format prior to training.




# Task 4
# Using the Attack dataset, create subsets for countries with at least 200 entries after data cleaning. For each country subset:
# (a) Train a classification model using Sex, Age, and Activity as features to predict the Fatal target variable.
# (b) Calculate and record the model accuracy.
# (c) Determine and report the most frequent year, derived from the Case Number field




# Task 5
# Using the Titanic dataset, build a predictive model with Age, Pclass, and Ticket-Cost as features, and Survive as the target variable. 
# Evaluate feature importance to determine which feature is the strongest and which is the weakest predictor of survival.




# Task 6
# Use an appropriate visualization to compare the total ticket cost for each passenger class.Interpret what this result reveals about the income structure of the Titanic company, 
# which class earned more and which one less.
